# data-structures-cpp-library
version 1.0 for my data structures library implemented in c++

# disclaimer
1. this library is a work in progress. future versions will include missing components and algorithms.
2. not all features are implemented for every data structure. the idea is on generalized implementations to help learning and ease of translation into languages like c, c#, or java.
3. testing is incomplete. feel free to provide feedback or suggestions.

# contents
implemented:
1. vectors
2. lists, singly linked lists (doubly linked and circular linked lists planned for future versions)
3. stacks, implemented using both lists and vectors
4. queues, implemented using both lists and vectors
5. dictionaries

coming in future versions:
2. trees
3. sets
4. pairs
5. hashmaps
6. graphs

i promise there will be more updates and expanded functionality!
