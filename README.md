# data-structures-cpp-library
version 1.0 for the data structure library implemented in c++

disclaimer:
1. data structures are missing components and algorithms that will be implemented in future versions
2. not everything is implemented for all data structures, implementations are general so that they can then be
modified according to specifics or even translated into other languages like c, c# or java
3. testing has not been applied to any of the files and implementations

contents:
1. vectors
2. lists (singly linked lists) (if needed i will also provide doubly linked and circular)
3. stacks (using lists and vectors)
4. queues (using lists and vectors) (coming on later versions)
5. dictionaries (coming on later versions)
6. trees (coming on later versions)
7. sets (coming on later versions)
8. pairs (coming on later versions)
