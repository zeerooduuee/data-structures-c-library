# data-structures-cpp-library
version 1.0 for my data structures library implemented in c++

disclaimer:
1. data structures are missing components and algorithms that will be implemented in future versions
2. not everything is implemented for all data structures, implementations are more general so that they can be usefult for learning and translating into other languages like c, c# or java
3. testing has not been done on any of the files

contents:
1. vectors
2. lists (singly linked lists) (if needed i will also provide doubly linked and circular)
3. stacks (using lists and vectors)
4. queues (using lists and vectors) (coming on later versions)
5. dictionaries (coming on later versions)
6. trees (coming on later versions)
7. sets (coming on later versions)
8. pairs (coming on later versions)
9. hashmaps (coming on later versions)
10. graphs (coming on later versions)
